### Is this script safe? 🛡️

Yes, this script is safe. It is designed to be as non-invasive as possible & it does not install any third-party software. If you want to see what the script does but you don't understand PowerShell, you can view the execution flow [here](docs/Refyne_Execution_Flow.md). Otherwise, you can view the source code [here](Refyne.ps1). It's all open-source. All of the changes made by this script can be found [here](docs/Refyne_Changes.md).

### My system broke because of your script! 😱

Rest assured, this script is designed not to cause any damage to your system. If you notice any performance issues, a restore point is automatically created each time the script is run for your convenience. Remember, by running this script, you accepted all responsibility for any potential outcomes.

### Windows 11 sucks! Where's the Windows 10 tweaks? 🤔

Firstly, it's a matter of personal preference and adaptation to change. Secondly, improvements for Windows 11 are currently in progress. If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to contribute. After all, this is an open-source project.

### Can I run this script on a machine older than 10 years old? 🖥️

It's plausible. My tests on machines as old as 2010, running Windows 11, didn't show any negative impacts. In fact, an ASUS gaming laptop with a 2nd gen i7, owned by my father, experienced significant improvements in usability. However, results may differ based on your specific hardware.

### I had an error, where can I go to get help? 🆘

For immediate assistance, visit [my Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ffW3vCpGud). Please be patient if no one is immediately available to help - everyone here is volunteering their time. If you need further assistance or are unsatisfied with the support, feel free to open an issue on GitHub.

### How can I contribute? 🤝

You can file a pull request, or reach out to me to discuss any potential tweaks you'd like to see added. I will review them with my fellow developer Luke and make the determination if it's valid. However, this script is fairly comprehensive as it is.

### Do you take tips? 💰

Only if you're willing! I accept tips via PayPal, Stripe and Cash App. I will also force Luke to take a portion of these tips, somehow or some way.
